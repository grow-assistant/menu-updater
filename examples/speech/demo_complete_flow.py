Demo script to show the complete flow of a query with date conversion
1. User inputs a query like "How many orders were completed on 2/21/2025?"
2. The system processes it (simulated here)
3. OpenAI generates a response with "February 21st, 2025" (simulated here)
4. SimpleVoice.clean_text_for_speech converts "21st" to "twenty-first"
5. The cleaned text would then be sent to ElevenLabs (not actually done here)

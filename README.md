## System Overview

### Core Components

1. **Frontend (Streamlit)**
   - **Chat Interface:**  
     Users interact with the AI assistant via a chat interface. The assistant can:
     - Update menu item details (e.g., price updates or toggling status).
     - Query menu information.
     - Fetch order data (e.g., total sales, revenue comparisons, frequent order metrics, etc.).
   - **Sidebar Navigation:**  
     - Location selection: Users choose the active location (e.g., restaurant branch) from a dropdown.
     - Database Schema Explorer: Visualizes the schema of the database.
     - Theme support: Dark/light mode with custom CSS for tooltips and other UI components.

2. **Database (PostgreSQL)**
   - **Schema Structure:**
     - **Locations, Menus, Categories, Items, Options, Option Items, Orders, Order Items, Ratings & Feedback.**
     - Columns include totals, timestamps, soft deletion flags, and ordering (via `seq_num`).
   - **Operations:**  
     Structured SQL queries are used for menu updates and order queries. Examples include:
     - Calculating total sales revenue for a month.
     - Comparing current month sales to the same month last year.
     - Determining top-selling menu items over a quarter.
     - Measuring average order values and time between orders.
     
3. **AI Integration (OpenAI API)**
   - **Function Calling:**  
     A set of functions is defined in **function_calling_spec.py** for the OpenAI client. Among these:
     - `categorize_request`: Determines what kind of request the user is making.
     - `update_menu_item` and `toggle_menu_item`: Execute menu update operations.
     - `query_orders`: Executes order queries against the database.
   - **Chat Processing Flow:**  
     The app compiles recent conversation history (within token limits), sends it to the OpenAI API, and checks for function calls. For a `query_orders` request, the app:
     - Retrieves the user's selected location from the sidebar.
     - Builds a SQL query (using natural language parameters like time period).
     - Executes the query using shared helper functions (mirroring tests in **tests/test_orders_query.py**).
     - Returns and displays the query results in the conversation.

---

## Application Flow

1. **Session Initialization (in app.py):**
   - **Session State Setup:**  
     Initializes the conversation history with system and assistant welcome messages.
   - **Location Selection:**  
     A sidebar dropdown loads available locations from the `locations` table. The default location (e.g., ID 62) is selected based on your configuration.
     
2. **User Interaction via Chat:**
   - A user types a query (e.g., "What was our total sales revenue for the past month?") in the chat interface.
   - The user's message is stored in the session state. All messages (user and assistant) are displayed in a Streamlit chat layout.

3. **Processing with the AI Assistant:**
   - The recent messages (filtered by token limits) are sent to the OpenAI API via the `run_chat_sequence()` function in **chat_functions.py**.
   - The OpenAI API, using the function calling specification declared in **function_calling_spec.py**, categorizes the request.
   - For order-related queries (`request_type == "query_orders"`), the assistant builds a corresponding SQL query:
     - Example: It constructs a query to calculate total revenue and order count using a date filter (e.g., today, this month, last month) and the selected `location_id`.
   - The SQL query is executed using a helper function (e.g., `execute_order_query()`), and the JSON results are returned to the chat.

4. **Displaying the Result:**
   - The assistant's response (including query results, status updates, etc.) is appended to the session state and displayed in the chat.
   - Token usage is tracked and displayed so that older messages are trimmed when necessary.

5. **Additional Operations:**
   - Menu update operations (e.g., updating prices, toggling an item's status) follow a similar flow and are executed via corresponding functions (`update_menu_item` or `toggle_menu_item`).
   - Other custom queries (mirroring those in **tests/test_orders_query.py**) can be integrated similarly by extending the function calling logic.

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/grow-assistant/menu-updater.git
   cd menu-updater
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment:**
   - Use Python 3.8 or higher.
   - Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).

3. **Set Up PostgreSQL:**
   - Install PostgreSQL.
   - Create a new database for the project.
   - Run any supplied SQL scripts to create the necessary tables.

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file with:
   ```ini
   DB_NAME=your_db_name
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   DB_SERVER=localhost
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Run the App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   The app will open in your browser (typically at http://localhost:8501).

## Testing Order Queries

A dedicated test file (**tests/test_orders_query.py**) contains SQL queries that are used to validate various order-related operations. These queries include:
- Total sales revenue for the past month.
- Sales comparison (this month vs. same month last year).
- Top menu items by revenue.
- Average order value over time.
- Average time between a customer's first two orders.
- Customer repeat order metrics and lifetime value.

These queries leverage the same database helper functions and SQL logic that are used when handling natural language queries in the chat interface.

---

## Conclusion

By following this flow:
- **User's queries** are processed through a natural language chat interface.
- **OpenAI function calling** allows for dynamic determination of request type.
- **Database helper functions** ensure consistency between test queries and production code.
- **Streamlit's UI** provides a sleek interface for both entering queries and visualizing results.

This integration ensures that all queriesâ€”from menu updates to comprehensive order analyticsâ€”are executed accurately, providing a seamless user experience with the full flow of the application.

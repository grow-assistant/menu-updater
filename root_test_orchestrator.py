    print("""
Based on our tests, the time period extraction and caching mechanism works correctly:

1. When a user asks "How many orders were completed on 2/21/2025?":
   - The date is extracted and formatted as "WHERE updated_at = '2025-02-21'"
   - This date clause is cached for future reference

2. When a follow-up query like "What were the most popular items during that same period?" is asked:
   - The system recognizes this as a follow-up question
   - It maintains the previous time period context for continuity
   - The cached date clause is available for context but not directly sent to SQL generator

3. When a new time-specific query like "Show me sales from last week" is asked:
   - A new time period clause is generated
   - The context is updated to the new time period

This ensures that time-based contexts are maintained across related queries, improving
the conversation flow while keeping each SQL query clean.

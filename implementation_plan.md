# Database Schema Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to improve the integration between the database schema and the rules system, ensuring proper field references and validation.

## Tasks

### 1. Create a structured YAML/JSON version of database_fields.md

- [ ] Convert the existing database_fields.md document into a structured YAML or JSON format
- [ ] Define tables as top-level objects
- [ ] For each table, define fields with their data types and constraints
- [ ] Include relationships between tables (foreign keys)
- [ ] Store the schema file in the resources directory
- [ ] Create a schema loader utility to programmatically access the schema

### 2. Update rules files to reference the correct field names

- [ ] Audit all rules files for database field references
- [ ] Update rules files (both YML and Python) to use the correct field names from the schema
- [ ] Implement a field name validation helper to verify field names against the schema
- [ ] Create automated tests to verify field references in rules are valid

### 3. Add schema validation to SQL generation process

- [ ] Implement pre-generation validation to check field names in queries
- [ ] Add table existence validation before generating SQL
- [ ] Verify relationship integrity when joining tables
- [ ] Add warnings or errors for mismatches between rules and schema
- [ ] Create unit tests for the validation process

### 4. Document table relationships explicitly in rules

- [ ] Add relationship declarations in the rules system
- [ ] Update the rules format to support relationship metadata
- [ ] Document primary key and foreign key relationships
- [ ] Create visualization of table relationships for documentation
- [ ] Update existing rules to include relationship information

## Benefits

These changes will ensure that the rules system properly reflects the actual database schema and will help prevent query errors due to incorrect field or table references. By introducing schema validation early in the SQL generation process, we'll catch potential issues before they cause runtime errors or incorrect data retrieval.

The explicit documentation of table relationships will also make the system more maintainable and easier to understand for new developers working on the project.

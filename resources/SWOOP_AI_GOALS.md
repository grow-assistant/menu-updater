# Swoop AI Project Goals & Requirements

## Project Overview
Swoop AI is an AI-powered restaurant data assistant that helps restaurant managers analyze data, manage menus, and answer business questions. The application uses LangChain to provide a sophisticated conversational interface with advanced capabilities.

## Core Goals

1. **Create a seamless, intuitive conversational interface**
   - Provide natural language understanding for restaurant-specific queries
   - Support both text and voice interactions
   - Maintain context across conversation turns

2. **Deliver accurate restaurant data insights**
   - Execute SQL queries based on natural language questions
   - Provide clear, concise summaries of data
   - Support complex analytical questions about orders, revenue, and menu performance

3. **Enable menu management through conversation**
   - Allow price updates via natural language
   - Support enabling/disabling menu items
   - Provide confirmation of changes

4. **Implement multi-modal interaction**
   - Voice output with persona-based responses
   - Voice input with speech recognition
   - Text-based chat interface with streaming responses

## Technical Requirements

1. **LangChain Integration**
   - Use agent-based architecture for complex reasoning
   - Implement custom tools for SQL and menu operations
   - Maintain conversation memory across sessions

2. **Voice Capabilities**
   - ElevenLabs integration for high-quality voice output
   - Multiple voice personas (casual, professional, enthusiastic, etc.)
   - Speech recognition for hands-free operation

3. **Multi-location Support**
   - Switch between different clubs/locations
   - Maintain separate contexts for each location
   - Clear history when switching locations

4. **Performance & UX**
   - Streaming responses for immediate feedback
   - Proper error handling and graceful degradation
   - Clean, branded UI matching Swoop's design language

## Success Criteria

1. Users can get accurate answers about:
   - Sales data and trends
   - Menu performance
   - Order statistics
   - Staff performance

2. Users can perform operations like:
   - Updating menu item prices
   - Enabling/disabling menu items
   - Analyzing performance across time periods

3. The system provides:
   - Both detailed text answers and concise verbal responses
   - SQL query transparency when relevant
   - Context-aware follow-up handling

## Implementation Notes

- Use OpenAI's models for core reasoning
- Implement fallback mechanisms when primary flow fails
- Ensure all SQL is properly sanitized and validated
- Maintain Swoop branding throughout the interface
- Support both desktop and mobile experiences

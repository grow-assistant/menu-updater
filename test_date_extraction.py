When a real user asks "How many orders were completed on 2/21/2025?", the OpenAI model should:
1. Identify the date pattern "2/21/2025"
2. Recognize it as a specific date (not a range or relative period)
3. Format it in SQL format as "2025-02-21" (YYYY-MM-DD)
4. Return a SQL WHERE clause like "WHERE updated_at = '2025-02-21'"

Based on our system prompt which includes date handling examples, and this test 
simulation, we can expect the system to correctly extract specific dates from queries.

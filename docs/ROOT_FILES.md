# Project Structure Documentation

This document provides an overview of the project structure and organization.

## Core Application Files

### `main.py`
The core application file containing the main functionality, including:
- Speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities
- LangChain integration for AI processing
- Streamlit UI components
- Database connectivity
- Response handling

## Directory Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `utils/` - Utility modules used throughout the application
  - Contains `speech_utils.py` with centralized speech processing functionality
  - Contains `logging_config.py` for setting up logging configurations
  - Contains `modify_logging.py` for modifying or fixing logging issues
  - Contains `run_with_logging.py` for running the app with logging enabled
  - Contains various other utility functions and modules
  
- `tests/` - Test files and test utilities
  - Contains `test_speech_utils.py` to test speech functionality
  - Contains `test_openai.py` to verify OpenAI API connectivity
  - Contains `test_prompt_logging.py` to test prompt generation functions
  - Contains `test_run.py` for simple application testing
  - Contains `simple_prompt_test.py` for minimal prompt logging tests
  - Contains `run_tests.py` for running all tests
  - Contains `test_questions.txt` with sample test questions
  - Contains `simplified_conversation_paths.txt` with test conversation flows
  - Contains `speech_tests/` - Tests for speech functionality including ordinal conversion
  
- `examples/` - Example scripts and demonstrations
  - `speech/` - Speech-related examples and demos
  
- `prompts/` - Templates and utilities for generating AI prompts
  
- `logs/` - Log files generated by the application
  - Contains application logs including `chat_functions.log`
  
- `database/` - Database-related code and utilities
  
- `docs/` - Documentation files
  - Contains this file (`ROOT_FILES.md`)
  - Contains `GIT_README.md` with Git usage instructions
  - Contains `LANGCHAIN_INTEGRATION.md` with LangChain integration details
  - Contains `CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` with instructions for project cleanup

## Configuration Files

The project includes several configuration files at the root level:

- `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies
- `setup.cfg` - Setup configuration
- `pyproject.toml` - Project configuration
- `.flake8` - Flake8 linter configuration
- `pycodestyle.ini` - Code style configuration
- `.env` - Environment variables (not tracked by git)
- `.gitignore` - Files and directories to be ignored by git

## Note on Ordinal Conversion

Several files in this project deal with converting ordinal numbers (e.g., "21st") to their word form (e.g., "twenty-first") for speech synthesis. This functionality has been centralized in `utils/speech_utils.py` to avoid code duplication.

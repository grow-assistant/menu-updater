# Define test markers for categorization
markers =
    unit: Unit tests that test individual components in isolation
    integration: Tests that verify interactions between components
    slow: Tests that take longer than 1 second to execute
    fast: Tests that execute quickly (less than 1 second)
    api: Tests that interact with external APIs
    db: Tests that require database connections
    smoke: Basic smoke tests to verify code is runnable

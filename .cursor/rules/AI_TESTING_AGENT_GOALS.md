# AI Testing Agent Goals & Requirements

## Project Overview
The AI Testing Agent is an OpenAI-powered testing framework designed to simulate user interactions with the Swoop AI Streamlit application. It runs in a headless mode through terminal logs instead of a web browser UI, focusing on automation, scalability, realism, and continuous feedback to support rapid development in "yolo mode."

## Core Goals

1. **Enable comprehensive automated testing**
   - Simulate diverse, realistic user interactions
   - Test entire conversation flows across multiple turns
   - Evaluate system responses for quality and accuracy
   - Provide detailed critique and recommendations

2. **Support "yolo mode" rapid development**
   - Deliver immediate feedback on code changes
   - Identify issues early in the development process
   - Enable high-volume, diverse test scenarios
   - Support continuous testing without manual intervention

3. **Ensure response quality and factual accuracy**
   - Validate responses against actual database records
   - Detect inconsistencies and factual errors
   - Evaluate natural language quality of responses
   - Identify potential user satisfaction issues

4. **Provide actionable developer feedback**
   - Generate specific, implementation-focused critiques
   - Categorize issues by severity and type
   - Suggest code improvements and optimizations
   - Track recurring issues across test runs

## Technical Requirements

1. **Headless Testing Architecture**
   - Streamlit session simulation without browser UI
   - Capture of all system responses and terminal logs
   - Support for concurrent test sessions
   - Accurate recreation of user interaction patterns

2. **AI-Powered Components**
   - OpenAI-driven user simulation with diverse personas
   - Conversation analysis with sophisticated NLP
   - Response quality evaluation across multiple dimensions
   - Automated test case generation and enhancement

3. **Dual-Agent Testing Approach**
   - Customer testing agent for user simulation
   - Critique agent for developer-focused feedback
   - Separate concerns for comprehensive testing
   - Standardized formats for actionable feedback

4. **Real-time Monitoring & Reporting**
   - Live tracking of test execution and metrics
   - Immediate notifications for test failures
   - Comprehensive dashboard with quality metrics
   - Detailed reports with actionable insights

## Success Criteria

1. Users can automatically test:
   - Complex multi-turn conversations
   - Response quality across different query types
   - Edge cases and error handling
   - Database validation and factual accuracy

2. The system provides:
   - Detailed, categorized issue reports
   - Implementation-specific recommendations
   - Quality metrics for each test run
   - Real-time feedback during development

3. Developers gain:
   - Confidence in code quality before deployment
   - Rapid identification of regressions
   - Insights into conversation flow weaknesses
   - Metrics-driven quality improvement

## Implementation Notes

- Use OpenAI's models for both user simulation and critique
- Focus on scalability to handle large test volumes
- Prioritize developer experience and actionable feedback
- Maintain flexibility to test new features quickly
- Enable integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing
- Support both targeted testing and broad coverage sweeps

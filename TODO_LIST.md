# TODO List for AI Testing Agent

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Fix import paths in run_modified_tests.py
- [x] Create proper config.yaml file
- [x] Fix errors in FixedSQLExecutor class
- [x] Copy real RulesService implementation into ai_testing_agent from main project
- [x] Copy YamlLoader implementation as a dependency for RulesService
- [x] Create proper directory structure for RulesService
- [x] Set up proper paths for RulesService resources in the config.yaml
- [x] Replace MockRulesService in run_modified_tests.py with the real RulesService

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Fix the "Query results were None or empty" issue by implementing real database connections
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for database connection failures
- [ ] Generate test results with actual responses
- [ ] Review test failures and fix any remaining issues

## Notes
- The real RulesService is now integrated, but we're still getting empty query results
- Need to focus on setting up a proper test database with sample data
- All tests are currently failing with "Query results were None or empty" errors
- Success rate is 0% across all test scenarios

## Implementation Guidelines
- Do not create new files in ai_testing_agent if equivalent files already exist in the project
- Reference existing SQL files from /c:/Python/GIT/swoop-ai/services/sql_generator/sql_files/
- Use existing test scenarios from test_scenarios/ directory
- Leverage existing monitoring and validation capabilities
- Use real service implementations from the codebase rather than creating mock versions
- Only fall back to mock implementations when absolutely necessary
